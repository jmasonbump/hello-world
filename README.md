We talkin bout practice

This serves as my first project on github, and my entry into the world of Lawyer3.0. I am a the keeper of the secret of the temple, the most loyal son of the castle on the hill, and a member of the inner circle. I am a coffee patrician and a whiskey wizard. I drink to the health of those long dead, and cheer onward the fortunes of those who never were.
